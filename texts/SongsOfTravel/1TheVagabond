The Vagabond
============

Give to me the life I love,
  Let the lave go by me.
Give the jolly heaven above,
  And the by-way nigh me.
Bed in the bush with stars to see,
  Bread I dip in the river
There's a life for a man like me,
  There's the life for ever.

Let the blow fall soon or late,
  Let what will be o'er me;
Give the face of earth around,
  And the road before me.
Wealth I seek not, hope nor love,
  Nor a friend to know me;
All I seek; the heaven above,
  And the road below me.

Or let autumn fall on me
  Where a field I linger,
Silencing the bird on tree,
  Biting the blue finger.
White as meal the frosty field
  Warm the fireside haven
Not to autumn will I yield,
  Not to winter even!

Let the blow fall soon or late,
  Let what will be o'er me;
Give the face of earth around,
  And the road before me.
Wealth I ask not, hope nor love,
  Nor a friend to know me;
All I ask, the heaven above,
  And the road below me.
