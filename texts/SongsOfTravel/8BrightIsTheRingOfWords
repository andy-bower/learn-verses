Bright is the ring of words
===========================

Bright is the ring of words
When the right man rings them,
Fair the fall of songs
when the singer sings them.
Still they are carolled and said
On wings they are carried
After the singer is dead
And the maker buried.

Low as the singer lies
In the field of heather,
Songs of his fashion
bring the swains together.
And when the west is red
With the sunset embers,
The lover lingers and sings,
And the maid remembers.
