All through the Night
(AR HYD Y NOS)
=====================

1. Sleep, my love, and peace attend thee,
  All through the night;
Guardian angels God will lend thee,
  All through the night.
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping,
Hill and vale in slumber steeping,
I my loving vigil keeping,
  All through the night.

2. Angels watching ever round thee,
  All through the night;
In thy slumbers close surround thee,
  All through the night.
They should of all fears disarm thee,
No forebodings should alarm thee,
They will let no peril harm thee,
  All through the night.
